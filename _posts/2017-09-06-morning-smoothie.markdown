This chocolate protein smoothie is one of my favorites. Plus it's a good excuse to have chocolate for breakfast (not that you need an excuse).

The peanut butter provides just enough salt to balance out the sweetness of the chocolate and banana. If you don't have a chocolate protein powder, you can add some cocoa powder to the mix.

Here's what you'll need:

* cashew milk
* almond milk
* 1 small banana or 1/2 of a large banana
* 1 spoonful of peanut butter
* 1 scoop chocolate protein powder (I like Orgain chocolate)

some optional additions:

* 1 pinch of maca powder
* 1 spoonful of coconut flakes
* 1 tsp coconut oil
* 1 tsp chia seeds
* 1 tsp cocoa powder
* 1 pinch sea salt if using unsalted peanut butter

I just pop everything into a Ninja blender, and add more liquid as necessary. That's it!
