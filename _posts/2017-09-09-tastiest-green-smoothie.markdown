This is possibly the tastiest smoothie you'll find out there that has a bunch of green goodness in it. So needless to say, I'm a big fan.

I love how the zing of the ginger cuts through the earthier greens, and the the orange juice adds the perfect amount sweetness to the mix. It's sure to give you a nice boost of energy to get through your day.

Here's what you'll need:

* 1 handful kale
* 1 handful Spinach
* 1 pre-chopped frozen banana (or a couple ice cubes if you don't have a frozen banana handy)
* 1 tbsp fresh chopped ginger, or however much ginger you can handle
* coconut stuff to taste - either flakes, oil, milk, or all 3. Your choice!
* enough orange juice to cover the other ingredients

Blend it up, and enjoy!
