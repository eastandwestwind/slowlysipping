Here are a couple clothing companies that embody some if not all of my requirements - durability, comfort, style, practicality.

[Cuyana](https://www.cuyana.com/) - Their motto is "fewer, better" - I can get down with that. Much of their style isn't aligned with mine (think purses, jewelry), but there are certainly some gems: [this](https://www.cuyana.com/open-cashmere-cardigan.html#oatmeal) cardigan, [this](https://www.cuyana.com/lightweight-cashmere-scarf.html#grey) scarf.

[Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/) - Affordable basics with classic style. On the site, you also get full transparency into the factories where the clothing is produced, as well as the true costs of making the product. You'll find in my closet: [this](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-cotton-heather-v-neck-charcoal?collection=womens-tees) versatile v-neck, [this](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-box-cut-tee-palebrown?collection=womens-tees) cropped boxy t. Since I'm a bit shorter than average (5'4"), I find most t-shirts to be way too long. The cropped t hits right at the top of my hip, which is perfect.

[Outdoor Voices](https://www.outdoorvoices.com/) - A super rad workout-to-casual clothing company. [These](https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/warmup?variant=1185791396) warmup leggings are my favorite, plus, [this](https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/merino-muscle-tank?variant=10866745029) merino blend tank. Merino is an awesome fabric for all seasons, as it manages heat well and doesn't retain odors.

[Feetures!](https://feeturesrunning.com/) - These are the longest-lasting pairs of socks I've ever owned. I've had some pairs for 5+ years, and they're still going strong, no signs of wear in the heel, where a typical sock would begin to have holes. Check out [these](https://feeturesrunning.com/product/high-performance-ultra-light-quarter) ultralight quarter socks. They don't make the style I have - ankle length straight across. They now do the "no show tab" style, which doesn't appeal to me as much.
