As a very recent full-time digital nomad, I had to narrow down my fairly large wardrobe into a couple versatile items. And let me tell you, this was no small task! 

I gave myself a couple weeks to iterate on exactly what I was bringing, and used the couple warm(er) spring days of Boston to have trial-runs of different outfits.

Still, though, nothing could've prepared me for the hot and humid weather I was to experience upon arrival in Thailand, so much of my decisions were based on research and sheer common-sense.

So here's what I ended up bringing (and yes, I definitely made mistakes my first time packing for long-term travel!):

In my Backpack (from top to bottom, left to right) - [Tom Bihn Aeronaut 30](https://www.tombihn.com/products/aeronaut-30):

<img style="float: right; width: 500px; margin-right: 50px; " src="/images/posts/synapse.jpg" />

* Baseball cap - Patagonia
* Laptop + case
* Water / tea bottle (insulated and lightweight) - from Zojirushi - 10/10 would bring again
* Toiletry kit for plane - from [Tom Bihn](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/accessories/products/3d-organizer-cube-clear) - things like lip balm, face wipes, deodorant, tissues, medicine
* Chargers
* Notebooks
* Passport
* Handkerchief
* Wireless mouse + Klipsch in-ear monitors
* Another small notebook
* Minimal wallet - from Taylor Stitch
* Glasses 
* Various pens
* Sunglasses - from [The Sunday Co](https://thesundayco.com/collections/eyewear/products/2-osaka-gloss-black)
* Wool sweater - from [Amour Vert](https://amourvert.com/products/sulia-cardigan?variant=1168318201875)
* Silk eye mask - from [Slip](https://www.slipsilkpillowcase.com/products/sleep-mask-black)
* Flashlight - came in handy for walking the streets of Koh Phangan at night, as well as for spotting ants
* Spork - when you need utensils, you NEED utensils
* Fanny pack - Patagonia - great for airports, too, to keep important items easily accessible.
* Pantyliners

In my carry-on - [Tom Bihn Synapse 19](https://www.tombihn.com/products/synapse-19)

* Linen travel towel - from [Goodlinens](https://www.goodlinens.com/collections/all/products/lightweight-travel-towel-blue)- doubles as a beach blanket / picnic blanket
* Film camera - my splurge item because it's so bulky and heavy! And sadly I've barely used it
* sun hat - ended up not using it since it bent out of shape pretty badly during travel
* 1 button-up white blouse + 1 bell-sleeve v-neck blouse
* 4 t-shirts + 1 sleeveless wool tank
* 2 wool sports bras + 1 padded sports bra
* sun visor for running - haven't used yet, but it packs up small so I'm not too mad
* 1 extra tote bag
* 4 pairs of pants (ended up not bringing the 1st pair)- linen wide-leg pants, lightweight culottes, soft cotton pants, leggings 
* 1 tank top - never wore this!
* 2 pairs of bathing suits
* Linen travel wash cloth - from [Goodlinens](https://www.goodlinens.com/collections/bath/products/two-ply-stripe-wash-cloth)
* 2nd handkerchief
* 2 pairs of shorts
* Toiletry kit - [from Tom Bihn](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/accessories/products/spiff-kit)
* 3 quick-dry undies from Exofficio
* 3 pairs socks
* 3 pair shoes (didn't have space for 1st pair) - birkenstocks, flip flops, tennis shoes
* Makeup kit
* Didn't end up bringing the packable rain jacket (and ended up not needing it!)
* Not pictured - [stuff sacks](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/accessories/products/travel-stuff-sack) and [packing cubes](https://www.tombihn.com/products/packing-cube-aeronaut-30) from Tom Bihn

Here's how the above looked all rolled up and in packing cubes and stuff sacks:

And here's how everything looked all packed up:

Here's what I would've done differently:

1. No compression leggings. Honestly, the humidity is so thick in Thailand that I could barely even get my leggings on!
2. Wide-leg pants and culottes are cute, but aren't the most versatile items, and I could only wear with certain shirts
3. More sleeveless shirts - with the heat and humidity, sleeveless and loose-fitting is the way to go
4. No film camera - it's tough to lug this around, and my iphone camera would've sufficed
5. Lighter-weight and more versatile sweater. The one I brought is pretty bulky and I would've survived with a lightweight windbreaker or something of that sort
6. Traded birkenstocks for the canvas sneakers - birks are not waterproof, so I'm pretty sure I ruined mine with being caught in a heavy downpour in Thailand. My canvas sneaks would be perfect in Japan, but I din't have enough space left for them!
7. No 2nd bathing suit - I really didn't need my black bathing suit, which I didn't like as much as the other pair
8. No makeup - at least not a dedicated bag of it - most of it will run off your face in humid weather, even if they say it's "run-proof" or "waterproof"
9. Traded flip-flops for Chacos or Tevas - I ended up actually hiking in my flip flops, since I had to be barefoot for part of the hike (easier to grip on rocks than my tennis shoes), and it was tough to keep putting on and taking off my tennis shoes. A pair of grippy water-proof shoes would've been much easier to deal with.
10. Larger and more mobile carry-on. Tom Bihn's Aeronaut is fairly small, and since I don't like the backpack straps, nor the shoulder straps, I end up just carrying it by the handle, which gets heavy while running around airports. In the future, I would get a small hard-case carry-on with 4 wheels to make it easier to transport around.
Plus, with a roller suitcase, I wouldn't have to worry as much about putting it down in a dirty spot (like the restroom)

And here's what I'm really glad I brought:

1. Quick-drying undies - soooo useful, because I can just wash the ones I wore in the shower, and they dry within 1/2 a day.
2. Flip flops - I was torn with which shoes to bring on my trip, but I'm wearing my flip flops most frequently, even though I actually think something like Chacos or Tevas would be even more versatile
3. Wool tank / sports bras - kept me comfortable in the heat, and didn't retain odors, plus they are fairly quick-drying
4. Sleep mask - don't know what I would've done without it
5. Linen towel + washcloth - both are quick-drying and don't retain odors!

That's it for now. I have yet to get to Japan in my travels, so I expect this list will change a bit. Stay tuned!
