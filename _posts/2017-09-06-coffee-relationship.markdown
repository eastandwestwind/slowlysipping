I'll refer to my beloved coffee as Tom. I love Tom. At least I think I still love him.

I'm anxious when I don't see him for a while.

I mean, being with him makes me feel good, but I think I may be getting too dependent on him. I can't even think straight when I haven't seen him in 24 hrs.

So I've told myself to keep some distance, to replace him with someone healthier for me. Maybe if I just have less and less of him each day, I won't want him any more.

But that never works. The less time I spend with him, the more I desire, and the more I suffer. I know I'll be over him in like a week if only I persisted. But why would I let myself suffer, even if only for a little while?

Plus I can always justify my seeing Tom with all these other dependent relationships people seem to have. That makes it ok, right?

 Tom gives me so much joy, how could I ever let that go?
