This is more of a stream of consciousness than anything else, but I believe it is vastly important to know what drives you, what motivates you, what makes you feel comfortable, and even what stresses you. Knowing yourself is the first step to better decision-making on a day-to-day basis.

Here are a couple things that feed my soul and make me smile:

Having a nest to decorate and call my own.  Indoor spaces with big windows and lots of sunshine. Hardwood floors, furniture close to the ground. Being outdoors. Big trees. Water. Sunshine filtering through the trees into a still section of a creek, reaching the shallow bed. Casual, carefree living. Hammocks.

Deserts. Driving through the desert. Traveling with almost nothing on me, just wandering. Hair flowing in the wind. Animals! Cats. Wildlife. Swimming alongside fish in the Galapagos Islands.

Stimulating environments, fun conversations. Being around different types of people. People who don't do small talk, but with whom I can immediately get to know. Amazing food and music all around. Going clubbing with amazing music and venue. Cross-pollination of ideas. Melding together ideas from different fields / topics.

Building things, and being proud of it. Making things better. Helping people. Making people's lives easier. Learning things on my own.

What gets you excited? What makes you a better person? And what are you doing today that nurtures those things?
