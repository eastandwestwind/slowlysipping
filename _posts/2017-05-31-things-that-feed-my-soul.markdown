Having a nest to decorate and call my own

Being around different types of people

Indoor spaces with big windows and lots of sunshine

Hardwood floors, furniture close to the ground

Being outdoors. Big trees. Water. Sunshine filtering through the trees into a still section of a creek, reaching the shallow bed.

Deserts. Driving through the desert.

Traveling with almost nothing on me, just wandering.

Hair flowing in the wind

Stimulating environments, fun conversations

Casual, carefree living. Hammocks.

Amazing food and music all around.

People who don't do small talk, but with whom I can immediately get to know.

Animals! Cats. Wildlife.

Building things, and being proud of it. Making things better. Helping people. Making people's lives easier

Going clubbing with amazing music and venue.

Cross-pollination of ideas. Melding together ideas from different fields / topics.

Swimming alongside fish in the Galapagos Islands.

Learning things on my own
