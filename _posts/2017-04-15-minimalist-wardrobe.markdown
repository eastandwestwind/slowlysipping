The most important and crucial step to building a minimal wardrobe is to first have a clear canvas. A clear canvas is a clear mindset, and a clear mindset begets clearer thinking.

My problem is that, yes, I have to admit it, if I'm not completely comfortable in clothing, I will *not* wear it. I think that most of the time, we trick ourselves into purchasing or keeping clothing that is flattering, but simply not something that makes us completely happy, inside and out.

Wearing clothes can, and should, have that effect. The principles I follow are : comfort, practicality, and simplicity - without sacrificing style, of course.

But before we can properly examine and re-evaluate what we desire in a minimalist wardrobe, we must clear the clutter in our lives. And by that, I mean excess clothes.

Clothing clutter builds up easily. Sales push us to buy things we would only wear a couple times, or things we don't really need at all.

Clothing easily becomes articles of nostalgia - items we only keep around because mother gave it to us that Christmas. We keep clothing around because we only have to slim down a teensy bit to properly fit into those jeans.

And then there's clothing that will only go with that one shirt, and not versatile at all - or we love the pattern and fabric, but it's really not comfortable to wear, and so we always manage to avoid wearing it. But it's so lovely to look at!

Clothing should be worn - and more than just a couple times a month.

Getting rid of clothing is not an easy process, and not one that should be done in just 1 day.

It is an iterative process that may take a week or a month. So bear with me.

1. Dig everything out. *Everything*. You'll want to do a first pass at clothing you simply don't and won't ever wear. Donate, sell, or give it to someone who might use it. Those mismatched orange halloween socks that were hiding in the back of your undies drawer? Yup. That sequined jean skirt your cousin gave you 6 summers ago? That too. Be thorough and honest with yourself. You'll want to be left with items of clothing you actually will wear.
2. Put everything that's left in a place that is visible when you go about your usual dressing routine. Using clothing hangers is the easiest. My mistake has been that if I don't see it, I probably won't think of wearing it. So this helps to have everything visible.
3. After wearing an item of clothing or washing it, place it in a special location - maybe put a divider in your closet, or maybe use a separate hanging area for the items of clothing you have worn. This way, you'll know what you actually do wear on a daily basis.
4. After a week or two - depending on how minimal you wish to be - take a look at what you have and haven't worn. Most likely, you can give away the items you haven't worn. If you have clothing that is season-specific, that may be a bit tough, but try to pare down what you can. If in doubt, examine why. What is the real reason you want to keep it? Do you really need it? Hint: get rid of it.

After all that, you should feel pretty happy with yourself. You should also feel lighter, overall. Make yourself a cup of tea and take a breath of fresh air. This is a great start, and will put you in the right frame of mind to make rational decisions about your wardrobe.
