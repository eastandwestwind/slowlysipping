Clearing out excess clothes is the first step to a better and more curated wardrobe. Like an artist with a blank canvas, you'll also need space to think clearly and rationally about future clothing purchases.

Clothing clutter builds up easily. Sales push us to buy things; clothing easily becomes articles of nostalgia that we keep around, gathering dust.

Or, sometimes, we trick ourselves into purchasing or keeping clothing that is flattering, but simply not something that makes us completely happy, inside and out.

Getting rid of clothing is not an easy process, and not one that should be done in just 1 day.

It is an iterative process that may take a week or a month.

1. Dig everything out. Go ahead and set aside the obvious items for donation.
2. Put everything that's left in a place that is visible when you go about your usual dressing routine.
3. After wearing an item of clothing or washing it, place it in a special location, or flip the hanger around to indicate use.
4. After a week or two - depending on how thorough you wish to be - take a look at what you have and haven't worn.

Comfort, practicality, and simplicity are key - without sacrificing style, of course. Clothing must be versatile.

When in doubt, I look to these principles in order to decide for sure which items are worth the closet (or luggage) space.
