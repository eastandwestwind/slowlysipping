A truly transformative mix, best listened to when wandering through the desert, or wandering through your own mind. One thing blends seamlessly into the other, as if the music were already out there in the multi-verse awaiting discovery. It leads you to question time itself, because you're only existing in the present moment, with memories and thoughts fleeting the moment they begin.

Hard-hitting drums and bass and earthy vocals come together in this next jam. The articulation of the bass is something to pay attention to as it highlights melodic aspects of the more robotic vocals in the chorus. Glitchy elements give way to a funky sax riff, sure to send you on your way.

I've always enjoyed music that mixes melodic elements with more rhythmic or even dirty sounds. Here's a great specimen of just that. The muddy / echoey vocals are in stark contrast with the cleaner electronics pulsating in the background as well as the very opening sparkles of light. But maybe they aren't so different after all, but merely a reflection of one another.
