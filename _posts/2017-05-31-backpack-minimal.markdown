What is backpack minimal?

Backpack minimal is the ability to sustain yourself partially, either fully living or simply traveling with belongings that fit into a backpack.

I'm not going to go into every detail, but just a couple important points to consider:

1. **Handwash!** You need less than you think, and, if you're willing to wash your clothes by hand, the bulk dramatically decreases.

2. **Wear wool:** Wool clothing tends to retain less odors and is breathable. I highly recommend investing in 1 good wool shirt / bra. I personally have 1 wool / silk blend shirt that I bring along on adventures and travels. It's slightly over-sized so that I can be comfortable sleeping in it. I wash it with a dab of baking soda in the sink, and it dries extremely quickly, which is a plus.

3. **Be smart about shoes:** Shoes are the biggest struggle for me when traveling, because I'm often not comfortable in 1 pair of shoes for too long, even if they are the most comfortable pair in the world. Shoes can take up a lot of room, so I bring 2 pairs to alternate between. Birkenstocks Arizonas are my go-to comfortable shoes. I'll even wear socks with them if it's colder out. Depending on where and what you'll be doing, narrow down to no more than 2 pairs.

4. **Pants:** This is straightforward, but bring the pants you wear every day. Not those "travel" zip-off pants that will pinpoint you as a tourist - I mean, unless you really do wear these every day. . . In any case, usually 1 pair of comfortable jeans + 1 pair of leggings or non-jean comfy pants will do.

5. **Toiletries:** It's easy to go overboard with toiletries. I recently went through an exercise where I didn't wash my face with any kind of cleanser or soap for a couple months, just some gentle scrubbing with a linen wash cloth. Surprisingly, my skin didn't appear less clean or have any breakouts. On the contrary, my skin felt balanced and comfortable. When I'm not traveling, I do use a gentle face cleanser, but it feels good to know I can go without it also. Once I was confident with this, it made me question other habits and routines I had.  What do we do out of habit and convention vs what we really need?

To summarize, half of backpack minimal is practical knowledge and the other half is more of a personal philosophy that takes practice and time.
