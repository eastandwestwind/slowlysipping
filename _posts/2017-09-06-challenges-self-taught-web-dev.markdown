I'd say challenges fall into 3 categories- challenges while learning, challenges applying to jobs, and challenges after getting a job.

# 1

**It’s tough deciding what and how to learn.**

  There’s so much content out there - frameworks, languages, books, online learning tools / tutorials, bootcamps, etc. It’s easy to get overwhelmed with everything.

  Companies love to see expertise in at least 1 thing- something you are excited about and can talk about fluently, whether it be a personal project or knowledge about comparing 2 different ways to do something and why 1 is better.

  I didn’t have much of a plan or curriculum, and my story isn’t exactly cohesive. Kinda like patch-work, learning about different things as I went along.

  But there are a few consistent themes I can pass along.

  Quickly assimilate knowledge by transforming what you learn.

  I did this by blogging about what I learned. Writing helps make sense of information and actually motivates you to do more research about it as you write.

  I also transformed knowledge by working on actual projects.

  Maybe follow an online tutorial for building a simple website. Or use an online emulator to get a feel for how css and js works- check out [codepen](https://codepen.io).

  This site is cool because you can explore people’s projects and make edits and see how things change as a result.

  Having a portfolio of things you’ve built is a great convo starter for job interviews and networking and stuff.

  Btw- use GitHub. Any good tech company will use version control and will expect you to know how it works.

  And as for the best thing out there the goes from A-Z? Try [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn).

  The "getting started with the web" module is a great place to start for like a complete beginner. And of course you can browse by more specific topic.

**Applying to jobs is can be disheartening.**

 I got so many rejections and non-responses. But I used the time to keep learning and keep building my portfolio.

 Companies want to see evidence that you can be successful working for them.

  It’s tough because sometimes (but not always!) companies see schooling = experience. But actually schooling ~= or even != experience.

  Computer science school doesn’t actually teach much how to code. They teach a lot of the science and theory behind the workings of computers and networks, but not a lot about coding best practices and real-life scenarios.

  A comp-sci degree is best suited for ppl interested in low-level dev-ops type stuff or ppl wanting to go into research professionally. Which isn’t to say it’s useless, but more of a supplementary thing and yeah, eventually good to fill in those gaps.

  But if you have some projects under your belt, and maybe a couple blog posts, you’re good to go.

  Don't let rejections get you down, just keep on going and keep learning.

 **I didn't feel as prepared as I wanted my first day on the job.**

  Nothing can prepare you fully for actually working as a dev for the 1st time. You can only be mostly prepared.

  Much of the knowledge is gained through actual experience.

  Something that is so helpful now that I wish I had learned sooner: I wish I had gotten more familiar with the dev tools, like in chrome, when you right-click and Inspect.

  The various tabs tell you so much, like the html on the page- how everything is structured, the css on each element - how it appears on the page, the network requests - what is actually loading on the page, and a console, where I can manually run javascript and test things out.

  With dev tools, I can test out different changes I wish to make before touching any of my own code. So so helpful now.

  The other thing is using a good code editor. A good code editor actually helps you learn and is essential when starting out. I really like using WebStorm.

  Know your shortcuts for finding text within a project and opening a file by name.

  Knowing your tools sounds really straightforward, but it’s something that’s rarely taught.
