This recipe is super simple and easy to put together, provided you have all the ingredients on hand.

And it's pretty much the best. Lunch. Ever.

I love everything avocado. The chopped kale adds a bit of crunch and texture to the softer avocado and quinoa, while the dijon mustard brings a welcome sharpness to the taste profile.

Let's get started:

* 1 cup chopped kale
* 1/2 cup dry quinoa
* 1 avocado
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* sea salt to taste
* freshly ground black pepper
* 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese

1. Start by cooking the quinoa with twice as much water, in a covered sauce pan
2. While that's going, chop up the kale and cut the avocado into cubes
3. When the quinoa is done but still hot, toss with the cheese in a mixing bowl.
4. Add the kale and dijon mustard.
5. Add avocado.
6. Add salt and black pepper to taste.
