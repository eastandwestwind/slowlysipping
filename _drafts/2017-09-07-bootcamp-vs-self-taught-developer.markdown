If you're like some of my friends, you might be considering getting into web dev. Just 5 min google searching, and I'm sure you've run across many bootcamps, some of which guarantee a job upon completion.

But they often cost a lot, which is one downside.

So, maybe you're considering as an alternative, like teaching yourself to code on your own free time. But this, too, has its challenges. There is so much content out there that you may not know where to start.

How do you decide?

Do you spend the money to be in a heavily structured and guided learning environment, or instead bootstrap your way to success?

**Know how you learn best.**

Be honest here. In the past, how have you typically learned best? In a classroom listening to a teacher? Reading a textbook? Hands-on? Lots of guidance or little?

Then do your research on that kind of approaches the bootcamps take to teach web dev to see if it fits with how you learn.

Or maybe you are most motivated by doing things on your own, in which case, you should really consider teaching yourself.

**How accountable are you?**

Are you disciplined enough to set aside time every day, or do you need more accountability?

In a bootcamp, you'll have the accountability of others expecting those things of you.

Bootcamp is one solution, but consider alternatives for being self-taught, like finding a mentor - someone you can check in with once or twice a week, or ask questions when you get stuck.

**Go for it.**

To wrap up, there isn't one set path to become a developer. For many, me included, the path is more convoluted, paved by many different experiences.

If you really set your mind to learning, you will learn.

No amount of money you pay for a bootcamp will make you learn to code if you're not ready to learn. Similarly, no number of hours sitting at your computer will make you a developer if you don't really want it.

So be real with yourself.

Figure out what you need to learn best, and code all the things.
